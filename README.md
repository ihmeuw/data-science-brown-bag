# IHME's weekly Data Science Brown Bag series

## The basics
- Everyone is invited
    - No prior knowledge or experience expected!
- Zero commitment
    - (Unless you're presenting...)
    - Topics will be posted by Monday, so you can decide whether it's useful to you
- _Quick_ intros to a topic
    - What is it?
    - Why do you think it's cool?
    - How can I get started?
    - Who should use it, and when?
    - Where can I learn more?
    - _Not_ a lecture!
- Brainstorming sessions
    - Quick summary of your problem
    - What you've already tried (if anything)
    - Ideally, a reproducible example or dataset
